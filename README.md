# Tire-and-Brake-Savers
When you run both the Tire Saver Overlay and Brake Saver Overlay, you essentially get a real time driving coach with you.

The Tire Saver indicates when you are turning your steering wheel beyond getting any more benefit and creating excessive tire wear in the corners.

The Brake Saver is telling you when you are exceeding the limits of the tire and again generating excessive wear on the tires.  Note:  The Brake Saver is NOT saving brakes.  I just liked keeping the names similar as pure marketing. :-).  They are both indicating tire wear.


Red = burning front tires.  Blue = burning rear tires.  That simple.  Keep the colors from going dark.

The Tire Saver works by calculating the difference between Lateral G and Steer Angle.  The result of that calculation tells us whether or not that we are putting more steering angle that what we need to achieve maximum Lateral G forces for the corner.  This indicates a push condition.  When we are getting Lateral G forces while turning in the opposite direction, this indicates that we have an oversteer condition.

The Brake Saver works on calculating the longitudinal g forces on the tires when they exceed the tire limits.  

Important!!!!
The NG Tire Saver will ONLY work on Next Gen cars.
The SR Tire Saver will ONLY work on cars that have Steering Ratios as settings in the garage.

The NG Brake Saver is ONLY tuned for Next Gen cars, but will work on others but the sensitivity may be incorrect.

You can see these Savers in action on the Busters Corner video here:
